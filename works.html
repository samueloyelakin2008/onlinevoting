  <h1>How It Works</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Official Voting Platform! Our system is designed to make voting simple, secure, and transparent for every user.</p>
  <p>To cast your vote, you select your preferred candidates and complete a secure payment of ₦100 per candidate via Paystack, a trusted payment processor. This payment confirms your vote and helps maintain the integrity of the election process.</p>
  <p>Once your payment is verified, your vote is recorded securely and anonymously in our system. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data and ensure that each vote counts only once.</p>
  <p>Our platform is built to be user-friendly, allowing you to participate anytime and anywhere with confidence.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact us through the provided support channels.</p>
